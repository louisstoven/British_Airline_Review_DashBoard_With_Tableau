# British Airline Reviews Dashboard Project

This repository contains a project to create a Tableau dashboard for visualizing and analyzing review and performance data of a British airline company. The data includes customer reviews, ratings, and internal key performance indicators (KPIs) to offer a comprehensive overview of the airline’s service quality and capabilities. The project is based on a dataset and visual guidance sourced from Mo Chen's YouTube tutorial.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an interactive, professional-grade dashboard in Tableau that provides insights into various aspects of customer feedback and airline performance.

## Data Source

- **CSV Data**: The dataset includes metrics and feedback for an airline’s customer experience. It was originally provided through Mo Chen's YouTube tutorial and contains attributes such as review scores, flight routes, cabin classes, and customer demographics.
- **Reference Image**: A mockup image of the target dashboard was used to guide design and layout.

## Instructions

1. **Data Import**:
   - Open Tableau and connect to the provided CSV file containing airline review data.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning, such as handling missing values or standardizing formats within Tableau.
   
3. **Dashboard Layout**:
   - Use the reference image as a guide to set up the dashboard layout, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive arrangement.
   
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Create bar charts, line graphs, and KPI summaries based on the data attributes, with specific focus on customer feedback metrics.
   - Add filters and parameters to enable interactivity.
   
5. **Final Touches**:
   - Adjust formatting, add titles, legends, and tooltips to improve readability and professionalism.
   
6. **Publish and Export**:
   - Publish the final dashboard on Tableau Public or export it as a PDF or image for sharing.
